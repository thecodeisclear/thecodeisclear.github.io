<p>Life for a programmer today is tough. The number of languages that are rolling out is increasing while at the same time, existing ones are radically changing. To get a job done, a coder can take any available path and while they reach the end, someone would point out that it is significantly easier to do the same in language X. To each his own, but what should prevail is the keenness to adapt, to learn a new language and soldier on.</p>

<p>I have formally learnt only C and COBOL, the former in college and since forgotten and the latter in a 8 week crash course before I began working. Over the years, I have tried to keep myself up-to-date on new trends and languages, without constraining myself to a particular OS. This <code>github</code> repo collection is my attempt to explore new languages and share my results in the process.</p>
